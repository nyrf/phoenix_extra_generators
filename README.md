# PhoenixExtraGenerators

Extra generator commands for [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/).

```
mix phx.gen.controller   # Generates a Phoenix controller
mix phx.gen.view         # Generates a Phoenix view
```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed by adding `phoenix_extra_generators` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`. You'll probably only need to include these in dev:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:phoenix_extra_generators, "~> 0.1.0", only: :dev}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_extra_generators](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_extra_generators).
